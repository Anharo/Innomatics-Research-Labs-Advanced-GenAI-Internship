# Python Programming Assignment – System Validation and Processing

## Introduction

This assignment focuses on implementing real-world validation and processing systems using Python programming concepts. Students will use Python functions, loops, conditions, and data structures such as lists, dictionaries, and strings to simulate real-world applications.

These exercises help strengthen logical thinking, improve problem-solving ability, and provide hands-on experience with systems commonly used in telecom services, inventory management, education platforms, transport systems, HR tools, and authentication systems.

By completing this assignment, students will learn how to build reliable, reusable, and efficient validation systems similar to those used in real-world software applications.

## Problem 1: Mobile Recharge Validation System

### Problem Statement

Create a function to validate a mobile recharge request based on predefined telecom recharge rules.

### Requirements

* Recharge amount must be greater than or equal to ₹50
* Valid recharge plans are: 199, 299, 399, 599
* User should be allowed to retry until a valid recharge amount is entered

### Hint

* Use a function to validate recharge amount
* Use a `while` loop to allow retry for invalid input

### Real-Time Applications

* Telecom recharge applications
* Mobile payment gateways
* Service provider recharge systems

## Problem 2: Inventory Reorder Alert System

### Problem Statement

A warehouse system maintains product stock levels. The system must identify products that require restocking.

### Requirements

* Print **Reorder Alert** if stock is less than 15
* Print **Stock OK** if stock is greater than or equal to 15

### Hint

* Use a function to check stock status
* Use a `for` loop to iterate through the dictionary

### Real-Time Applications

* Warehouse management systems
* Retail inventory tracking
* Supply chain monitoring systems

## Problem 3: Student Result Processing System

### Problem Statement

Create a function to evaluate student performance based on their marks.

### Requirements

* Accept a list of student marks
* Calculate the average marks
* Return **Pass** if average is greater than or equal to 50
* Return **Fail** if average is less than 50

### Hint

* Use a loop to calculate total marks
* Use a return statement to return result

### Real-Time Applications

* Online examination systems
* Student evaluation portals
* Academic performance tracking systems

## Problem 4: Cab Fare Estimator with Retry Option

### Problem Statement

Create a cab fare calculator that estimates ride fare based on distance and peak hour conditions.

### Requirements

* Base fare = ₹50
* ₹12 per kilometer
* Add 25% extra during peak hours
* Allow user retry using a while loop

### Hint

* Use a function to calculate fare
* Use a `while` loop for retry

### Real-Time Applications

* Ride-hailing applications (Uber, Ola)
* Transport fare systems
* Travel cost estimation systems

## Problem 5: Employee Attendance Eligibility Checker

### Problem Statement

Create a function to determine employee eligibility based on attendance percentage.

### Requirements

* Accept attendance list containing "P" (Present) and "A" (Absent)
* Calculate attendance percentage
* Return **Eligible** if attendance percentage is greater than or equal to 75
* Return **Not Eligible** otherwise

### Hint

* Use a loop to count present days
* Use return statement to return eligibility status

### Real-Time Applications

* HR payroll systems
* Internship eligibility tracking
* Employee attendance monitoring systems

## Problem 6: Password Strength Checker

### Problem Statement

Create a function to validate password strength based on security requirements.

### Requirements

* Minimum password length must be 8 characters
* Password must contain at least one digit
* Password must contain at least one special character (@, #, $)

### Hint

* Use a loop to iterate through password characters
* Use conditions inside function to validate requirements

### Real-Time Applications

* Login authentication systems
* User registration systems
* Security validation systems
