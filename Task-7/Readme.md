# Python Programming Assignment – Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS) Systems

## Introduction

This assignment focuses on implementing real-world systems using Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS) concepts in Python. Students will use classes, objects, constructors, and methods to simulate real-world applications such as smart home devices, employee management systems, contact records, retail billing systems, entertainment platforms, and logistics systems.

These exercises help strengthen logical thinking, improve understanding of class-based design, and provide hands-on experience with software systems built using object-oriented principles.

By completing this assignment, students will learn how to design structured, reusable, and maintainable systems similar to those used in real-world software development.

## Problem 1: Smart Light Controller

### Problem Statement

Create a class to control a smart light that can be turned ON or OFF and display its status.

### Requirements

* Create a class to represent a smart light
* Store the light name as an attribute
* Create methods to turn the light ON and OFF
* Display the current status of the light

### Hint

* Use a constructor (`__init__`) to initialize the light name
* Use methods such as `turn_on()` and `turn_off()`

### Real-Time Applications

* Smart home automation systems
* IoT-based device control systems
* Home assistant applications

### Sample Input

```
Light Name: Bedroom Light
Action: ON
```

### Expected Output

```
Bedroom Light is ON
```

### Requirements

* Store employee name, ID, and department as attributes
* Create a method to display formatted ID card information

### Hint

* Use a constructor to initialize employee details
* Use a method such as `display_id_card()`

### Real-Time Applications

* Corporate HR systems
* Employee identity management systems
* Office access control systems

### Sample Input

```
Employee Name: Rahul
Employee ID: EMP102
Department: IT
```

### Expected Output

* Use a method such as `display_contact()`

### Real-Time Applications

* Mobile contact applications
* Customer relationship management systems
* Phone directory systems

### Sample Input

```
Contact Name: Anita
Phone Number: 9876543210
```

### Expected Output

```
Contact Saved
Name: Anita
Phone: 9876543210
```
