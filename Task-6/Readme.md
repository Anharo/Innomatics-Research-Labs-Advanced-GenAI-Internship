# Task 6: Function-Based Problem Solving
---
## 📌 Overview

This repository contains solutions for **Task 6: Function-Based Problem Solving**, assigned as part of the **Data Science Internship – February 2026**. The objective of this task is to develop real-world problem-solving skills using Python functions, data structures, and logical reasoning.

Each problem simulates a real-world system such as parking management, food delivery estimation, server monitoring, and event registration systems. The solutions are implemented using clean, modular, and well‑documented Python code.
