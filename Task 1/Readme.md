## 1️⃣ User Login Check

### 📝 Problem Statement

Given a username and password, check whether login is successful.

```python
username = "admin"
password = "1234"
```

### ✅ Requirements

* Print **"Login Successful"** if both username and password match.
* Otherwise, print **"Invalid Credentials"**.

### 🌍 Real-World Application

Authentication systems used in websites and applications.

## 2️⃣ Pass / Fail Analyzer

### 📝 Problem Statement

Analyze student results.

```python
marks = [45, 78, 90, 33, 60]
```

### ✅ Requirements

* A student passes if **marks ≥ 50**.
* Count the total number of pass students.
* Count the total number of fail students.
* Print the final result clearly.

### 🌍 Real-World Application

Academic evaluation systems.

## 3️⃣ Simple Data Cleaner

### 📝 Problem Statement

Clean and standardize user names.

```python
names = [" Alice ", "bob", " CHARLIE "]
```

### ✅ Requirements

* Remove extra spaces.
* Convert all names to lowercase.
* Print the cleaned list.

### 🌍 Real-World Application

Data preprocessing before analysis.

---

## 4️⃣ Message Length Analyzer

### 📝 Problem Statement

Analyze message sizes.

```python
messages = ["Hi", "Welcome to the platform", "OK"]
```

### ✅ Requirements

* Print the length of each message.
* Flag messages longer than 10 characters.

### 🌍 Real-World Application

Text filtering and validation systems.

---

## 5️⃣ Error Message Detector

### 📝 Problem Statement

Detect error messages from system logs.

```python
logs = ["INFO", "ERROR", "WARNING", "ERROR"]
```

### ✅ Requirements

* Count the number of "ERROR" entries.
* Print the total error count.

### 🌍 Real-World Application

Monitoring and log analysis systems.
